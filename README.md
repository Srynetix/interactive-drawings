# Interactive Drawings

A project I made for my daughter's 4th birthday where you turn your drawings into living creatures in a small forest.

This project is composed of two Godot projects (its a kind of mono-repo):

- The viewer (which is also the server)
- The configurator (which is also the client)

## Tools used

- Blender for 3D models and texturing
- Affinity Designer for the drawing template
